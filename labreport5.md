# Lab Report 5 #

**Part 1**

*Student's Question*

Hi, I was working on Lab Report 4, and noticed that I keep getting a TestTimedOutException, even though I believe I did everything correctly. I believe I did not edit the code correctly, and it has resulted in an infinite loop. I have added a picture of the code that I am working with.

*TA's Answer*

Hello, thank you for reaching out! When you edited the code, which while loop did you edit? It seems that you changed the wrong variable, which resulted in an infinite loop. Instead, try seeing if there is another similar variable that can be changed, which would better solve your problem.

*Student's Response*

OH! That makes sense. I had changed the wrong variable. I changed `index1` to `index2` on the last while loop, and my test cases are now passing. I understand that my initial thought process was wrong, and by changing the wrong variable, it lead to an infinite loop. This is my message I get when I run the tests now! Thank you!

**Part 2**

A cool thing that I learned from my lab experiences during the second half of this quarter was the use of vim. At first, I saw little use for vim, but now I understand how it is extremely easy to navigate through text or code. Different vim commands make it so time efficient to trace through code or to fix errors. Doing this repetitively can add up to a lot of saved time. I also found this editor interesting because of how many commands it uses that are specific to itself. For example, using `yy` to copy a line, or using letters to move the cursor around. I understand that vim is heavily utilized in the Software Engineering field, which makes me glad that I have become familiar with how to navigate with it.
