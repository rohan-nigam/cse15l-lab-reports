# Lab Report 5 #

**Part 1**


**Part 2**

A cool thing that I learned from my lab experiences during the second half of this quarter was the use of vim. At first, I saw little use for vim, but now I understand how it is extremely easy to navigate through text or code. Different vim commands make it so time efficient to trace through code or to fix errors. Doing this repetitively can add up to a lot of saved time. I also found this editor interesting because of how many commands it uses that are specific to itself. For example, using `yy` to copy a line, or using letters to move the cursor around. I understand that vim is heavily utilized in the Software Engineering field, which makes me glad that I have become familiar with how to navigate with it.
